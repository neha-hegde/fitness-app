                            * Choose higher fibre or wholegrain varieties, such as wholewheat pasta, brown rice or potatoes with their skins on.\n
                            * They contain more fibre than white or refined starchy carbohydrates and can help you feel full for longer.\n
                            * Try to include at least 1 starchy food with each main meal.\n\n
                            2. Eat lots of fruit and veg\n\n
                            * Its recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and veg every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.\n
                            * A portion of fresh, canned or frozen fruit and vegetables is 80g. A portion of dried fruit (which should be kept to mealtimes) is 30g.\n
                            * A 150ml glass of fruit juice, vegetable juice or smoothie also counts as 1 portion, but limit the amount you have to no more than 1 glass a day as these drinks are sugary and can damage your teeth.\n\n
                            3. Eat more fish, including a portion of oily fish\n\n

                            * Aim to eat at least 2 portions of fish a week, including at least 1 portion of oily fish.\n
                            * Oily fish are high in omega-3 fats, which may help prevent heart disease.\n\n
                            4. Cut down on saturated fat and sugar\n\n

                            * On average, men should have no more than 30g of saturated fat a day. On average, women should have no more than 20g of saturated fat a day.\n
                            * More than 22.5g of total sugars per 100g means the food is high in sugar, while 5g of total sugars or less per 100g means the food is low in sugar.\n\n
                            5.Do not skip breakfast\n\n
                            * Some people skip breakfast because they think itll help them lose weight.\n

                            * A wholegrain lower sugar cereal with semi-skimmed milk and fruit sliced over the top is a tasty and healthier breakfast.</string>
